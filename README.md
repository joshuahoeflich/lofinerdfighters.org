### Developing

You will need to have `node 14` and `npm 6.14.11` installed. Then, simply clone the repo and run `npm install` to get started. If you've never used TypeScript, React, or Gatsby before, feel free to make an issue asking for help. A few tips:

- Run `npm start` or `npm run develop` to start Gatsby in development mode.
- Run `npm test:watch` to run the tests in watch mode in the background.

I like to open up two terminals running those commands, but your workflow may vary.
